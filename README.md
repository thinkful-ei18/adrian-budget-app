### Budget App

The Budget App is a work in progress that will allow you to create and list out your bills then mark them off as they've been paid. After registering, you can add your monthly income and your first bill, then you'll be taken to a dashboard where you can fine-tune your bills. When you return later and log back in, you'll be taken back to the dashboard.
